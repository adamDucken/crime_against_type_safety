here is my school project that violates all coding laws, and good practices, 
basically i am trying to roll my own auth in next from scratch without using auth libraries,
doing that probably wasnt best idea but whatever it works that is all that matters,
the image below was initial plan, but i implemented few things differently, when i will have time i 
will update it, you can use this as inspiration, i hope you enjoy reading that mess, my regards adam ducken
